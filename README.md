Abstract of our paper:

Using ultrasonic guided wave technology to quantify defects has always been challenging, especially for non-array electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs). This is not only related to complex defect feature extraction and signal processing algorithms, but also related to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the EMAT. Therefore, to solve the above-mentioned problems in high-precision defect quantification using EMAT, we propose a high-intensity unilateral oblique focusing (UOF) EMAT. Based on this new EMAT, the principle of guided wave defect quantification was studied, and then a theoretical-informed progressive residual deep convolutional network (ProResNet) was developed. The results show that the proposed UOF-EMAT can not only realize the unilateral focusing of the guided wave signal, but also increase the signal intensity of the preset focal position by 11 dB. In addition, compared with the quantization results of general shallow and deep neural networks, the defect quantization error of ProResNet is reduced by about 9-10 times and 1.6-5.2 times, respectively. Therefore, the proposed theoretical-informed ProResNet based on UOF-EMAT is proved to have higher accuracy in the quantification of ultrasonic guided wave defects.
